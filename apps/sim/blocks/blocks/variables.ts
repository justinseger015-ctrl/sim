  longDescription:
    'Set workflow-scoped variables that can be accessed throughout the workflow using <variable.variableName> syntax. All Variables blocks share the same namespace, so later blocks can update previously set variables.',
  bgColor: '#8B5CF6',
  bestPractices: `
  - Variables are workflow-scoped and persist throughout execution (but not between executions)
  - Reference variables using <variable.variableName> syntax in any block
  - Variable names should be descriptive and follow camelCase or snake_case convention
  - Any Variables block can update existing variables by setting the same variable name
  - Variables do not appear as block outputs - they're accessed via the <variable.> prefix
